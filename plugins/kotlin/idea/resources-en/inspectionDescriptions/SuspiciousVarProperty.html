Reports <code>var</code> properties with default setter and getter that doesn't reference backing field.
<p>A <code>var</code> property with default setter and getter that doesn't reference backing field have no effect on calling its setter,
    therefore it will be more clear to change such property to <code>val</code> and delete the initializer.</p>
<p>'Change to val and delete initializer' quick-fix can be used to amend the code automatically.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
// This property always returns '1' and it doesn't important that the property is a 'var'
var foo: Int = 0
    get() = 1
</code></pre>
