Reports unary operator followed by a dot qualifier such as <code>-1.inc()</code>.
<p>Code like <code>-1.inc()</code> can be misleading because <code>-</code> has a lower precedence than <code>.inc()</code>.
    As a result, <code>-1.inc()</code> evaluates to <code>-2</code> and not <code>0</code> as it might be expected.</p>
<p>'Wrap unary operator and value with ()' quick-fix can be used to amend the code automatically.</p>
